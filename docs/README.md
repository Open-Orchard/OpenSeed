#Welcome to OpenSeed's documentation project.

**Note: All these documents are considered rough drafts and will change often.**

Our mission is to make open-source software development economically competitive with private solutions by providing developers with turnkey backend solutions that make it easier than ever to bootstrap games and applications that utilize digital assets to engage users and generate revenue.

To that end, we will create a reusable, federated, open-source tool that enables developers to easily integrate state-of-the-art decentralized database technologies into their existing stack, without having to suffer from scalability, useability, and cost constraints by "hybridizing" these databases with mature and scaleable database technologies.

OpenSeed is essentially a collection of scripts and utilities that enable developers to build their applications faster and at lower cost when compared to closed source or system exclusive tools. OpenSeed achieves this by integrating its services with the Steem blockchain which is a stable, fast, and cost effective means of ensuring data integrity while simultaneously providing a robust backbone for data synchronization and long term data storage.

"The blockchain" was not designed for real-time operations or for ephemeral communications, which has left many blockchain-powered applications lacking in basic functionalities like easy account creation and messaging. That's why OpenSeed will have its own network of servers which are optimized for serving functions like these and interfacing with decentralized databases like Steem.

###OpenSeed is being developed on two fronts.

1. A web app capable set of tools to easily integrate OpenSeed into any existing or new application that wants a standardized set of tools that OpenSeed provides.(JavaScript)

2. A singleton that can be added to any game created by the Godot Game engine that offers the same benefits as the web app version.
